    <h2>keyframes animation-name</h2>
    <p>
        <pre>
            @keyframes frame1 {
                from{}
                to{
                    transform: translateX(500px);
                }
            }
            animation-name: frame1;
        </pre>
    </p> <br>

    <h2>animation-duration</h2>
    How much time should the animation take to complete.
    <pre>
        animation-duration: 3s;
    </pre> <br>

    <h2>animation-iteration-count</h2>
    How much times should the animation repeat.
    <pre>
        animation-iteration-count: 3s;
    </pre> <br>

    <h2>animation-timing-function</h2>
    Properties to time within the animation.
    <pre>
        animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
    </pre> <br>
    
    <h2>animation-delay</h2>
    How much time after should the animation start.
    <pre>
        animation-delay: 1s;
    </pre> <br>

    <h2>animation-direction</h2>
    How much time after should the animation start.
    <pre>
        animation-direction: reverse;
        (Will start animation from end position).
        animation-direction: alternate-reverse;
        (Will start animation from end position and repeat starting from staring positon).
        (Can be used for simple harmonic function)
    </pre> <br>

    <h2>animation-play-state</h2>
    It can be running or paused, ideally implemented through javascript. paused state will pause the animation wherever it is (it can be in between any animation).
    <pre>
        animation-play-state: paused;
    </pre> <br>
    
    <h2>Shorthand Property</h2>
    <pre>
        animation: name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction fill-mode;
        animation: frame1 2s ease-in 1s  reverse;
    </pre> We can miss a property in between as well.<br>

    <h2>animation-fill-mode</h2>
    by default - none
    <pre>
        animation-fill-mode: forwards;
        (the animation will be played until the end and then will be filled with the last value of the animation. (it will stop at end position))
        animation-fill-mode: backwards;
        (will stay at the initial postion(position befire animation) after the animation.)
    </pre> We can miss a property in between as well.<br>

    The keyframes will be applied to the element from the start to the end of the animation. the animation-delay will start after the first keyframe is applied.

    <h2>keyframes according to percentage</h2>
    <pre>
        @keyframes frame2 {
            0% {
                transform: rotate(25deg);
            }
        
            25% {
                transform: rotate(45deg);
            }
        }
    </pre> <br>

    <h2>Applying multiple keyframes</h2>
    <pre>
        animation: frame1 2s ease-in 1s forwards, frame2 2s ease-in 1s 2;
    </pre>
