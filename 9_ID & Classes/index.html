    <h1>Id & Classes</h1>
    To give multiple classes we can use space.
    One element cannot have mutliple id. <br>

    To target class in CSS we use . and we use # for id<br>
    We can use id to target the element in a webpage, we can take id of a element and paste it after url and placing a hash before it.


    <div id = "First_div" class = "class-red class-yellow" >First Div</div>
    <span id="First_span" class="class-red"> Span with red class </span>
</body>
